<h1>My School</h1>
<img src="maxcy.jpg" width="700" height="500">
<p>I am an English major with a minor in History. I'm currently a barista at Starbucks. School is okay and my professors are nice. 
I don't do much around campus expect stay in my room and write poetry and drink antifreeze on ice. Just joking, friend.</p>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<img src="jellyfish.jpg" width="700" height="500">
<p> I like reading, music, coffee, movies, video games, water. Also, jellyfish, campfires, tattoos, sweaters, poetry, pretty colors, nicotine, ice cream, soda, reptiles, mammals, birds, not being made fun of, making fun of people. Also, records, water, green things, blue things, purple things. Feeling sleepy, scared, and vulnerable. I hate being humiliated. K, bye.</p>
